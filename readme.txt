The user wants me to rephrase the provided information about the "Sahyadri - The Sentinel of Maratha History" project into a step-by-step format.

1.  Introduce the project's purpose:** Start by explaining what the "Sahyadri" project is and its core mission (preserving Maratha history and ensuring trekker safety).
2.  Describe the MVP:** Break down the core functionalities of the initial version of the platform.
    Informative web pages about forts.
     Modern and responsive design.
    The innovative SOS alert system.
3.  Detail the key features: Elaborate on the specific components.
    Forts Showcase: List and briefly describe the forts featured (Pratapgad, Rajgad, Torna).
    SOS System: Explain how the safety feature works, the technology used (Flask, `smtplib`), and the security measures (app-specific password).
4.  Outline the project structure: Use a simple, easy-to-read list to show the main files and directories.
5.  Provide instructions on how to run the project: Present the commands in a clear, sequential order.
    Clone the repository.
    Install dependencies.
    Configure Gmail credentials.
    Run the Flask application.
    Access the website.
6.  Summarize future enhancements:** List the planned features to show the project's potential.
7.  Explain the "Built With" technologies:** List the technologies used for the project's development.
8.  Justify the project's success criteria:** Explain why it's a winning project by highlighting its impact, innovation, technical excellence, and completeness.

This step-by-step structure will make the information clear and easy to follow, similar to how a user might read a "How-to" guide or a project's documentation. I will present this information in a numbered list format for maximum clarity. I will use markdown to format the titles and code snippets as they were in the original text, but the overall structure will be a numbered list as requested.Sahyadri - The Sentinel of Maratha History is a web platform with a dual mission: preserving Maratha history and ensuring the safety of trekkers. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the project in a step-by-step format.

 Step 1: Core Mission & MVP
The project's goal is to provide an accessible and secure resource for exploring the rich history of Maratha forts. The initial version (MVP) was built with three core components:
Informative Web Pages: Static HTML pages with detailed descriptions and historical context for prominent forts.
Interactive Design: A modern, responsive CSS design to enhance the user experience.
SOS Alert System: A backend service that allows a user to send an emergency text message.

Step 2: Key Features
The platform is built around two main features:

Forts Showcase:The website provides dedicated sections for iconic forts, including:
    Pratapgad: Known for the historic battle between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Afzal Khan.
    Rajgad: The first capital of the Maratha Empire.
    Torna: The first fort captured by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.

SOS System (`app.py`):** The most innovative feature, this safety protocol is designed for trekkers in distress.
    Mechanism: A Python-based backend using the Flask framework.
    Process: When a user triggers an alert, the application sends a POST request with the user's mobile number, carrier, and a message.
    Technology: It leverages the `smtplib` library to send an email to a mobile carrier's gateway (e.g., `@txt.att.net`), which then delivers the message as an SMS.
    Security: Uses a more secure Gmail app-specific password instead of the primary account password.

 Step 3: Project Structure
The project is organized with a clear directory structure to separate different components:
app.py: The Flask backend for the SOS system.
aboutus.html: The "About Us" page with fort details.
aboutus.css: The stylesheet for the "About Us" page.
images/: A directory containing various fort images.
README.md: The main documentation file.

 Step 4: How to Run the Project
You can get the project up and running by following these steps:
1.  Clone the repositorygit clone <repository-url>
2.  Navigate to the project directory:cd Sahyadri
3.  Install dependencies:pip install Flask
4.  Configure Gmail Credentials:In app.py, replace the placeholder password with your own Gmail App Password.
5.  Run the Flask application:python app.py
6.  Access the website: Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000.

 Step 5: Future Enhancements
The team has a clear roadmap for the project's future, including:
Interactive Map: Integrate a map to show fort locations and trekking routes.
User Authentication: Implement a user system to save favorite forts and manage emergency contacts.
Real-time Location Sharing:** Enhance the SOS system to include GPS coordinates.
AR Integration: Use the provided 3D model to create an immersive virtual tour.
More Forts: Expand the database to include a wider range of historical sites.
Language Support: Add support for regional languages like Marathi.

 Step 6: Justification for Success
The project is considered successful because it meets key criteria:
Impact: It solves a real-world problem for trekkers by providing a practical safety solution.
Innovation: It uniquely combines historical information with a life-saving feature.
Technical Excellence: It demonstrates a clear understanding of full-stack development with clean, modular code.
Completeness:The MVP is fully functional and provides a clear vision for future development.
